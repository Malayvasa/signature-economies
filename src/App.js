          Public blockchains present a paradox of ownership. No-one controls
          them and anyone can use them, given a connection and an ability to
          speak the common tongue. The network is ownerless, yet anyone who
          creates a key ‚Äòowns‚Äô any coins associated with it, so everyone is an
          owner. This confusion reveals how ‚Äòownership‚Äô is shifting and
          highlights the opportunity we have not to implement an ‚Äòownership
          economy‚Äô, but to reimagine what being an owner means.
        </div>
        <div>
          We can begin this process by asking, ‚ÄúWhat do I actually control?‚Äù
        </div>
        <div>
          In Bitcoin, I can sign over an unspent transaction output to another
          address. In Ethereum and other account-based models, I can sign a
          message which changes a value stored in shared state<sup>1</sup>. In
          each case, I am not the sole possessor or controller, I am a signatory
          on an event shared with everyone who participates in the network.
        </div>
        <div>
          So, ownership in digital economies is really about the meaningful
          signatures required to execute state changes while maintaining
          consensus. Is ownership shifting from an ability to demonstrate
          control or{' '}
          <a href="https://kernel.community/en/conversation/hospitality/#freeing-civilization">
            possession
          </a>{' '}
          to the ability to make meaning? If so, the change in signification is
          a radical one, because ownership is traditionally about exclusive
          rights, whereas meaning is made valuable by{' '}

          ends by pointing out that this network differs from traditional art

        </div>
        <div>
          Perhaps all this work is not about the right to control, but
          responsibility? Having no intermediaries creates certain benefits, but
          it is - as always - a tradeoff: if you misplace your mnemonic, it
          means no more magic internet money and there is no customer service to
          help you. This can be addressed by{' '}

          and, in the context of responsibility not just for our own keys but
          the recovery of others, ‚ÄúMake meaningful economies‚Äù is a more crafty

          The phrase ‚Äònot your keys, not your coins‚Äô is often used to connote
          sovereign rights. If you hold the keys, then you have an absolute and
          unimpeachable right to sign as you please. It turns out, though, that
          managing your own keys is risky and hard. The user experience of this
          is bad not because we lack great designers, but because responsibility
          is an inherently difficult feature for which to design<sup>3</sup>.
          This is because response-ability is not about discrete, individual

          messages which change the state of a network no-one controls require

          All of which brings us to the word ‚Äòsignature‚Äô. It connotes both that
          which is irreducibly and uniquely you - your signature dish, signature

          , it is at once singular and iterable. A wonderful phrase that carries
          the same kind of paradoxical structure is the isiZulu saying, ‚Äúumuntu
          ngumuntu ngabantu‚Äù: a human being is only a human being through other
          human beings. We have here the possibility of individuation: you can
          become a full human being; but you can only do so in community. You
          can only do so through fulfilling your responsibilities in
          relationship, not through asserting your rights.

          Even the word ‚Äòeconomies‚Äô contains this same double-directedness. It
          comes from the Greek oikos, which means ‚Äòhouse‚Äô. Sustainable household
          management requires micro insights into each of our habits, as well as
          macro perspectives of our shared habitations, including the planet
          which{' '}

              The meaning of any word can be described with three interrelated
              concepts: the signifier, the signified, and the sign. Consider the
              word ‚Äòdog‚Äô. The actual word, d-o-g, written on your screen is the
              ‚Äúsignifier‚Äù. The idealized picture of a four-legged furry creature
              wagging its tail that is called up in your mind when you read the
              word is the ‚Äúsignified‚Äù. The ‚Äúsign‚Äù is this particular shiba inu
              in all its singular glory. This works with words for which we all
              share common experience, like dogs or cats or fancy hats. But what
              about complex words like dao or buddha or christ? These words
              certainly signify something, but the violent history of
              institutionalized religion reveals that it is clearly not shared
              and that the only way to approach meaningful description in
              natural language is through negation: ‚ÄúThe dao that can be named
              is not the eternal dao‚Äù. What signatures allow for, though, is not
              only negation, but the possibility of positive response in the
              sense Viktor Frankl meant in <i>Yes To Life</i>.
